    <h2><a id="seminar"></a>Seminar</h2>
    <font size="4">
        <h3>General Guidelines</h3>
         The Department shall form an Internal Evaluation Committee (IEC) for the seminar
        with academic coordinator for that program as the Chairperson/Chairman and seminar
        coordinator & seminar guide as members. During the seminar presentation of a
        student, all members of IEC shall be present.<br><br>
         Formation of IEC and guide allotment shall be completed within a week after the
        University examination (or last working day) of the previous semester.
         Guide shall provide required input to their students regarding the selection of topic/
        paper.<br><br>
         Choosing a seminar topic: The topic for a UG seminar should be current and broad
        based rather than a very specific research work. It's advisable to choose a topic for the
        Seminar to be closely linked to the final year project area. Every member of the project
        team could choose or be assigned Seminar topics that covers various aspects linked to
        the Project area.<br><br>
         A topic/paper relevant to the discipline shall be selected by the student during the
        semester break.<br><br>
         Topic/Paper shall be finalized in the first week of the semester and shall be submitted
        to the IEC.<br><br>
         The IEC shall approve the selected topic/paper by the second week of the semester.
         Accurate references from genuine peer reviewed published material to be given in the
        report and to be verified.
